This project is a **full-stack user management system** that integrates a **React**-based ****frontend**** with an **Express** and **MongoDB** **backend**. The application allows individuals to create accounts, log in, and manage their profiles, while also supporting an **administrative role** that enables broader user oversight and management. The system is designed to be both a learning platform for web development practices and a practical demonstration of building a secure, *role-based application*.

On the **frontend**, the application is implemented with **React** and **React** Router for seamless navigation between pages. Users can access a login page, a sign-up page, a home page, and an update page. The login page validates credentials by communicating with the **backend**, while the sign-up page enables new users to register with details such as first name, last name, username (email), password, and an optional designation as an administrator. Once logged in, non-admin users are directed to a personalized home page that greets them by name, while administrators are presented with a dynamic table of all registered users. From this table, administrators can update or delete user accounts, with update operations redirecting to a dedicated form that pre-loads existing details, and deletion requiring confirmation through a modal dialog. Bootstrap is used on the **frontend** for responsive styling and user-friendly modals, while **React** state hooks are employed for managing user information throughout the application lifecycle.

The **backend** is powered by **Express.js**, **MongoDB**, and Mongoose. A user schema defines the data model, which includes fields for personal details, authentication credentials, and the administrative role flag. Backend routes handle authentication, registration, profile updates, and account deletion. When a user attempts to log in, the server validates the username and password combination and responds with role information, which determines whether the client renders an admin or user interface. For administrators, the backend provides endpoints that return all user records and support CRUD operations on them. Middleware is configured to handle CORS requests, ensuring compatibility with the **React** development server.

This project demonstrates an end-to-end workflow for building a modern web application that requires authentication and role-based access control. By combining **React** for the interface, ****Express.js**** for server logic, and **MongoDB** for persistent storage, it provides a foundation that can be extended to larger production-grade systems. The integration of Bootstrap for styling and **React** Router for navigation highlights practical **frontend** development practices, while Mongoose ensures structured database interactions on the **backend**. Overall, the system is intended to show how full-stack technologies come together to implement user **authentication**, **authorization**, and profile management in a clean and maintainable way.
